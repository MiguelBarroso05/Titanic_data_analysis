  Backend: Titanic Data Analysis API

üñ•Ô∏è Backend: Titanic Data Analysis API
======================================

Overview
--------

This backend API is designed to serve data analysis and insights on the Titanic dataset for a web application. The backend allows the frontend to interact with the dataset, perform data cleaning, and fetch survival rate statistics and visualizations based on various criteria (e.g., class, gender, age). The API exposes endpoints to access analysis results.
